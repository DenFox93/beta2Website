A DBMS is the software that manages a database, and it allows other programs or users to interact with a database. <br />Databases on an internal network will be connected to and queried by software, such as a web application or a virtual private network (VPN) server.<br />As a general rule, a database should not be directly accessible from the outside of the internal network.<br />Most common DBMS for <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/ranking">https://db-engines.com/en/ranking</a><br />   ◇ Oracle<br />   ◇ MySQL<br />   ◇ Microsoft SQL Server<br />   ◇ PostgreSQL<br />   ◇ MongoDB<br /><br /><strong>Essential Features of DBMS</strong><br /><table class="table"><tr><th>Feature</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>Concurrency</td><td>A real-world application might have multiple users interacting with it simultaneously. A DBMS makes sure that these concurrent interactions succeed without corrupting or losing any data.</td></tr><tr><td>Consistency</td><td>With so many concurrent interactions, the DBMS needs to ensure that the data remains consistent and valid throughout the database.</td></tr><tr><td>Security</td><td>DBMS provides fine-grained security controls through user authentication and permissions. This will prevent unauthorized viewing or editing of sensitive data.</td></tr><tr><td>Reliability</td><td>It is easy to backup databases and rolls them back to a previous state in case of data loss or a breach.</td></tr><tr><td>Structured Query Language</td><td>SQL simplifies user interaction with the database with an intuitive syntax supporting various operations.</td></tr></table><br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>Common approach to exploit a Database</strong><br />1. Find a way to access the database and the data it holds.<br />2. Enumerate the schema and learn the structure of the database.<br />3. Access the database and search for any useful information.<br />4. Review any permissions or security controls on the database.<br />5. Attempt to gain database administrator (DBA) rights if you do not already have them.<br />6. Attempt to access the underlying OS and its file system.<br />7. Attempt to exploit UDFs to run your own code.<br />8. Attempt to escape the database and attack the host OS; escalate privileges.          <br /><br /><strong>Tools</strong><br />Microsoft SQL Management Studio → to target Microsoft databases<br />PostgreSQL<br />MySQL<br /><br />How handle very sensitive data in the database<br />inform your client immediately and work with him to resolve the issue immediately <br /><br />Bibliography: <br />• &quot;Hands on Hacking - Become an Expert at Next Gen Penetration Testing and Purple Teaming&quot; by Matthew Hickey, Jennifer Arcuri <br />             <br />             <br />             <br /><br /><br /></div>
