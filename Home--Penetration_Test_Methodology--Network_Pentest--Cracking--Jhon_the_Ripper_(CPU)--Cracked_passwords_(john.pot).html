<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Cracked passwords (john.pot)</h1><br/>When John cracks a password successfully, it displays the cleartext password on the screen and stores the hash and cleartext password in a file called <strong>john.pot</strong> in its run directory.<br /><span style="text-decoration:underline;">John optimizes its performance by not loading any hashes that are already cracked and stored in john.pot!</span><br />    A penetration tester need to be aware of this behavior because John does not provides indication that it is ignoring a given password hash. It just ignores it, loading other password hashes from the file.<br />    <br />To view which passwords from a given password file have already been cracked:<br />    <div class="codebox"><pre>john --show [password_file]</pre></div><br /><br />To view the passwords that John has already cracked:<br />    <div class="codebox"><pre><span style="color:#ff9d00;font-weight:700">cat</span> ~<span style="color:#ff9d00;font-weight:700">/</span>.john<span style="color:#ff9d00;font-weight:700">/</span>john.pot</pre></div></div>
