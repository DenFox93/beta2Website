<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>POST</h1><br/><br /><br />Unlike HTTP GET, which places user parameters within the URL, HTTP POST places user parameters within the HTTP Request body. <br /><br /><strong><h3>POST main benefits</h3></strong><br />• <strong>Lack of Logging</strong>: As POST requests may transfer large files (e.g. file upload), <span style="text-decoration:underline;">it would NOT be efficient for the server to log all uploaded files as part of the requested URL</span>, as would be the case with a file uploaded through a GET request.<br />• <strong>Less Encoding Requirements</strong>: URLs are designed to be shared, which means they need to conform to characters that can be converted to letters. <br />   The POST request places data in the body which can accept binary data. The only characters that need to be encoded are those that are used to separate parameters.<br />• <strong>More data can be sent</strong>: The maximum URL Length varies between browsers (Chrome/Firefox/IE), web servers (IIS, Apache, nginx), Content Delivery Networks (Fastly, Cloudfront, Cloudflare), and even URL Shorteners (bit.ly, amzn.to). Generally speaking, a URL&#39;s lengths should be kept to below 2,000 characters, and so they cannot handle a lot of data.<br /><br /></div>
