<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>-b <FTP relay host>: FTP bounce scan</h1><br/><strong>FTP bounce scan</strong> (also known as <span style="text-decoration:underline;">FTP Bounce Attack</span>) is another stealthy scan option we can use. <br />This type of attack use the feature of FTP server to support <em><span style="color:#a020f0;">proxy FTP connections</span></em>(user that connect to a FTP server, can ask to sent a file to a third-party server).<br />Because an attacker can abuse of <span style="color:#a020f0;">this feature</span> most servers have ceased supporting it.<br />One of the abuses <span style="color:#a020f0;">this feature</span> allows is causing the FTP server to port scan other hosts. Simply ask the FTP server to send a file to each interesting port of a target host and the error message will describe whether the port is open or not. <br />This is a good way to bypass firewalls because organizational FTP servers are often placed where they have more access to other internal hosts than any old Internet host would.<br /><br /><div class="codebox"><pre>nmap -p 22,25,135 -Pn -v -b &lt;username&gt;<span style="color:#ff9d00;font-weight:700">:</span>&lt;password&gt;@&lt;FTP_server&gt;<span style="color:#ff9d00;font-weight:700">:</span>&lt;FTP_port&gt;  &lt;host_to_scan&gt;</pre></div><br />   •  <strong>&lt;Server&gt;</strong> → is the name or IP address of a vulnerable FTP server<br />   •  <strong>&lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt;</strong> → can be omitted as with a normal URL, in which case anonymous login credentials (user: anonymous password:-wwwuser@) are used. <br />   •  <strong>&lt;FTP_port&gt;</strong> → can be omitted as well(with its preceding colon), in which case the default FTP port (21) on &lt;server&gt; is used<br /><br /><br />bibliography:<br /><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTP_bounce_attack">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTP_bounce_attack</a><br /><a href="https://nmap.org/book/scan-methods-ftp-bounce-scan.html">https://nmap.org/book/scan-methods-ftp-bounce-scan.html</a></div>
