<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Classes of XSS</h1><br/><strong><h3>Classes of XSS</h3></strong><br />Though there are different ways of classifying XSS flaws that some professionals will employ, the most common way of categorizing them is as:<br /><br /><strong><h3>Classification 1</h3></strong><br /><table class="table"><tr><th>Reflected (Type 2)</th><th>Stored (Type 1)</th><th>DOM-Based (Type 0)</th></tr><tr><td>Not-Persistent</td><td>Persistent</td><td>Not-Persistent/Persistent</td></tr><tr><td>Input processed Server-side
Input given by Client</td><td>Input Processed Server Side
Input Stored Server Side</td><td>Input processed client-side
(Input given by Client OR
Input Stored Server Side)
</td></tr></table><br /><br /><br /><strong><h3>Classification 2</h3></strong><br />There is also this new classification from <a href="https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/Unraveling_some_Mysteries_around_DOM-based_XSS.pdf">https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/Unraveling_some_Mysteries_around_DOM-based_XSS.pdf</a><br /><br /><a href=""><img src="images/1589-1.png" alt="images/1589-1.png" /></a><br /><br /><strong>Server XSS</strong><br />• Server XSS occurs when <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Untrusted data is included in the generated response(HTML/JavaScript)</span><br />  The entire vulnerabile code is in server-side code, and the browser is simply rendering the response and executing any valid script embedded in it.<br />• The <span style="color:#ffa500;">source</span> payload could be from:<br />   ◇ request → Reflected Server XSS (Type 1)<br />   ◇ stored location → Stored Server XSS (Type 2)<br /><br /><strong>Client XSS</strong><br />• Client XSS occurs when <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Untrusted data is NOT included in the generated response(HTML/JavaScript)</span> but the Untrusted data is added to DOM (or eval’d) through unsafe JavaScript call. So it is JavaScript that has added the <span style="color:#ffa500;">source</span> payload to the page, rather than it being in the page at that location when it was first loaded in the browser.<br />• The<span style="color:#ffa500;"> source</span> of the data could be from:<br />   ◇ request → Reflected Client XSS<br />   ◇ stored location →  Stored Client XSS<br />• DOM Based XSS is simply a subset of Client XSS<br />   ◇ DOM Based XSS can be both Reflected or Stored<br />   ◇ There are Client XSS vulnerabilities that are not DOM based XSS since there are some Javascript Sinks that does not refer to DOM object (<a href="https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/Unraveling_some_Mysteries_around_DOM-based_XSS.pdf">here for more</a>)<br />  <br />  <br />  <br /><br /><strong>Non-Classes of XSS:</strong><br />They could sounds like classes of Cross-Site Scripting but they are not Web Application flaw<br />• <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Universal Cross-Site Scripting (UXSS)</span> → It is a method of injecting JavaScript by means of exploiting a separate tool. The most common UXSS targets are, the browser and associated plugins.<br />• <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Self-XSS</span> → It is an attack that involves tricking victims into copying or typing commands into the address bar that lead to adversary-controlled JavaScript execution<br /></div>
