<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>UNION query based</h1><br/><strong><h3>Usually used for:</h3></strong><br />• In-Band/Inline based SQLi<br /><br /><strong>UNION prerequisites</strong><br />• The number of columns being returned with our additional UNION SELECT must match the number of the original SELECT. DB Syntax Errors will occur otherwise<br />• The types of data returned in the columns must be compatible with the associated columns into which the data will be returned.<br />• We will need to know about specific tables that can be targeted. <br /><br />When a web application contains a SQL injection vulnerability that occurs in a SELECT statement we can can use the <strong>UNION</strong> operator to perform a second query that combine its results with those of the first as if it were within a single table. This second query, correctly set, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">can extract arbitrary data from the database</span>. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>bibliography:</strong><br />• The Web Application Hacker&#39;s Handbook<br /></div>
