<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Assessment Report</h1><br/>This section provides the results of the vulnerability assessment of [machine] and describes the potential risks affecting the analyzed system.<br /><br /><strong>3.1 Summary of analysis performed</strong><br />Security assessment verifies the compliance to security requirements. Main checks performed are:<br />• Status of Operating System Hardening based on CIS benchmark: File-system Configurations, Boot Settings Configuration, OS services configurations. Network Configuration, User Account Configuration, etc.;<br />• Status of the system software patching with a focus on security related patches;<br />• Verification of Configuration of the services and of custom software installed on the systems with the aim to evaluate if services/software are configured in the right and secure way (e.g. SSH configuration, Web Server Configuration, etc.);<br />• Presence and configuration of the security software components e.g. ACLs, VPN, tcpwrapper.<br /><br /><strong>3.2 Overview of vulnerabilities</strong><br />	The following figure shows the system vulnerabilities, related to the missing security patches, along with their degree of severity:<br />	<br />	-------<br />	Image <br />	--------<br /><br /><strong>3.3 Vulnerabilities Description</strong><br />The following sections provide a more technical description of the detected vulnerabilities along with risks that vulnerabilities may introduce, and the necessary actions recommended as mitigation activities.<br /><br /><strong>3.3.1 Missing patches and updates</strong><br />[machine] Operating System is an Ubuntu Server release 18.04.5 LTS<br />The system is affected by vulnerabilities having a wide range of severity: High, Medium and Low.<br />The following is a list of packages for which security updates are available, sorted by critical level.<br /><br /><table class="table"><tr><th>Risk Level</th><th>Installed Package</th><th>Fixed Package</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td></tr><tr><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td></tr></table><br />Newer patches may be released after the vulnerability scanning. It is recommended to check and update the system packages to the latest available version.<br /><br /><strong>3.3.2 Unsecure configurations</strong><br />The following is a list of improperly configured assets which may pose a threat to the system along with actions recommended as hardening measures.<br /><br /><strong>3.3.2.1 Network Configuration</strong><br />IPv6 is not disabled<br />If IPv6 is not actually used, but it still supported. It should be disabled to reduce the attack surface of the system and it is also used by network interfaces.<br />It is recommended to disable ipv6 support on the system<br />Edit /boot/grub/grub.conf to include ipv6.disable=1 on all kernel lines<br /><br /><strong>3.3.2.2 Filesystem Configuration</strong><br /><span style="text-decoration:underline;">File permissions</span><br />[World Writable files]<br />The following files are World Writable, that can be modified and compromised by any user<br />on the system:<br />................<br />[SUID binary]<br />The following SUID file “.........” can be abused to determine the existence of files also over not authorized path.<br /><br /><strong>3.3.2.3 System Services</strong><br />It is recommended to remove password authentication if not used and use key-based as main authentication mechanism<br />...............<br /><br /><strong>3.3.2.5 Unnecessary software</strong><br />Several packages have been detected installed in the system and their usage is not clear.<br />Unnecessary software should be removed to prevent misuse and reduce attackable surface area.<br />The following list (not exhaustive) includes some potentially dangerous/unnecessary software installed:<br /><br /><br /><strong>3.3.3 Conclusions</strong><br />Security Assessment performed on [mchine] has detected that packages on the system has been recently updated.<br />There are packages installed on the machine and misconfigurations that if exploited could permit Privilege Escalation and Denial of Service attacks.<br />This is mainly due to new discovered vulnerabilities, security settings and file permissions that are not restrictive enough.<br />Two types of actions are required to further reduce the security risks of [machine] system.<br />Following main countermeasures:<br />• System Update/Software Update (with decreasing criticality)<br />	....................<br />• Configuration Tuning (with decreasing criticality)<br />   → Filesystem configuration<br />   → Network configuration<br />   → System Services<br />   → Unnecessary software<br />   → Additional Hardening measures</div>
