<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Mitigation</h1><br/>Two main types of protection against SSRFs exist: <br />• <strong>block-lists</strong>: lists of banned addresses. <br />    The server will block a request if it contains a blocklisted address as input.<br />    Because applications often need to fetch resources from a variety of internet sources, too many to explicitly allow, most applications use this method. <br />    Companies blocklist internal net-work addresses and reject any request that redirects to those addresses.<br />• <strong>allow-lists</strong>: list of allowed addresses<br />    The server allows only requests that contain URLs found in a predetermined list and rejects all other requests.<br /><br />Some servers also protect against SSRFs by requiring special headers or secret tokens in internal requests.</div>
