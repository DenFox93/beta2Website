<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>SQL injections(SQLi)</h1><br/><br /><br />A SQL injection occurs when a malicious user attempts to pass input that changes the final SQL query sent by the web application to the database, enabling the user to perform other unintended SQL queries directly against the database<br /><br /><a href="Home--Penetration_Test_Methodology--WebApp_Pentest--Exploitation--Server-side--Injection--SQL_injections(SQLi)--Databases.html">HERE</a><span style="text-decoration:underline;"> we can do a recap of how work SQL<br /></span><br /><br /><strong><h3>How it works</h3></strong><br />Many of the languages used to develop web applications implement an <strong>interpreter</strong>, example of the languages: SQL, LDAP, Perl, PHP<br />An <strong>interpreted language</strong> is one whose execution involves a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">runtime component</span> that interprets the language’s code and carries out the instructions it contains.<br />Because of how interpreted languages are executed, a <strong>family of vulnerabilities</strong> known as <span style="text-decoration:underline;">code injection</span> arises<br />Therefore, the <strong>code that the interpreter processes</strong> is a <span style="color:#ff8700;text-decoration:underline;">mix of the instructions</span> written by the programmer and the <span style="color:#00ff2d;">data supplied by the user</span>.<br />The result is that, <span style="color:#00ff2d;">part</span> of <span style="color:#ff8700;">this input</span> gets interpreted as program instructions, which are executed in the same way as if they had been written by the original programmer.<br />A successful injection attack that <span style="color:#ff8700;">modifies a query</span> (<span style="color:#00ff2d;">and not merely the data within the query</span>) can bypass the application’s discretionary access controls and gain unauthorized access<br /><br />The Injection is possible on: <br />   ◇ <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Relational Databases</span>: <br />But Not Possible on:<br />   ◇ <span style="text-decoration:underline;">NonRelational Databases(NoSQL)</span>: <br /><br /><br /><br /><strong><h3>What we need to keep an eye on</h3></strong><br />While <span style="text-decoration:underline;">SQL injection is typically not found as commonly as before</span> (due to new changes such as PHP Data Objects (PDO), a database access layer providing a uniform method of access to multiple databases types) it is still always worth testing for as they may be filtering certain characters to prevent SQL injection. <br />One thing to note is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">typically legacy code is more vulnerable to SQL injection</span> so keep an eye out for old features. <br />When <span style="text-decoration:underline;">testing for SQL injection yes you could simply use </span><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">&#39;</span></strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;"> and look for errors</span> but a lot has changed since the past &amp; these days a lot of developers have disabled error messages so<br /><a href="ation_Test_Methodology--WebApp_Pentest--Exploitation--Server-side--Injection--SQL_injections(SQLi)--SQL_Injection_Types--Time_Based_blind.html">Sleep payload</a><strong>(Blind SQLi)</strong> usually will slip through any filtering.  As well as this it is easier to indicate if there is a delay on the response which would mean your payload was executed blindly. <br /><br />Bibliography:<br /><a href="https://academy.hackthebox.com/">https://academy.hackthebox.com/</a></div>
