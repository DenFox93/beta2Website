<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Fuzzing</h1><br/><br /><strong>Manual Testing</strong><br />In many cases, to exploit the vulnerability, it may require a custom payload that matches its specific configurations. Furthermore, when dealing with security measures like a WAF or a firewall, we have to apply our understanding to see how a specific payload/character is being blocked and attempt to craft a custom payload to work around it<br /><br /><strong>Automated Testing</strong><br />Automated methods that can help us quickly identify and exploit trivial LFI vulnerabilities. We can utilize fuzzing tools to test a huge list of common LFI payloads and see if any of them work, or we can utilize specialized LFI tools to test for such vulnerabilities.Â <br /><br /><strong>Bibliography:</strong><br /><a href="https://academy.hackthebox.com/">https://academy.hackthebox.com/</a></div>
