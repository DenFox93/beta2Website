It uses user ID and password for authentication<br />   1) The client sends a request without authentication information with its first request. <br />   2) The server&#39;s response contains the WWW-Authenticate header field, <br />      ▪ which requests the client to provide the credentials<br />      ▪ This header field also defines details of how the authentication has to take place<br />      ▪ In this response, the server transmits the so-called realm, a character string that tells the client who is requesting the data.<br />   3) The client uses the Base64 method for encoding the identifier and password.<br />      ▪ This encoded character string is constructed by concatenating the username and password, and encoding it in Base64<br />      ▪ This encoded character string is transmitted to the server in the Authorization header field<br />      ▪ This token is stored and managed by the browser, which automatically adds it to the Authorization header of every subsequent request as follows:<br />     <a href=""><img src="images/2083-1.png" alt="images/2083-1.png" /></a><br />     <span style="color:#ff0000;">Failed Login</span><br />    <a href=""><img src="images/2083-2.png" alt="images/2083-2.png" /></a><br />    <span style="color:#1e90ff;">Successful Login</span><br />    <a href=""><img src="images/2083-3.png" alt="images/2083-3.png" /></a><br />    For a number of reasons, this is generally not considered a secure authentication method. Firstly, it involves repeatedly sending the user&#39;s login credentials with every request. Unless the website also implements HSTS, user credentials are open to being captured in a man-in-the-middle attack.<br /><br /><br />2. <strong>Proxy Server Authentication</strong> is used to authenticate the user to an intermediate proxy server.<br />These two mechanisms work very similarly as they use requests, response status codes, and response headers. However, there are differences in the status codes and header names used.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Hydra Module For Basic HTTP authentication</strong><br />http[s]-{head|get|post}<br /><br /><br /><br />Bibliography:<br /><a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/password-based">https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/password-based</a></div>
