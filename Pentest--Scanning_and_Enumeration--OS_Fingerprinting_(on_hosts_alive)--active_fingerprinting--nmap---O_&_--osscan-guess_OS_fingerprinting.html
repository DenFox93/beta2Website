<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>-O & --osscan-guess: OS fingerprinting</h1><br/>To do <span style="text-decoration:underline;">OS fingerprinting</span> with <strong>nmap</strong> on alive hosts:<br /><div class="codebox"><pre>nmap -n -v -O --osscan-guess  &lt;target&gt;</pre></div><br /><br /><br /><br />OPTIONS: <br /><strong>-O</strong> →  Enables OS detection, as discussed above. Alternatively, we can use -A to enable OS detection(-O) but also others options -sV,-sC, --traceroute. If a host doesn&#39;t respond to ping probes but we know that is alive we can use -Pn in conjunction <br />    <div class="codebox"><pre>nmap  -O --osscan-guess  192.168.1.1,6,7,67,98,76 <span style="color:#0088ff;font-weight:400"># scan only on targets up found with ping sweeping</span></pre></div><br />      ◇ --osscan-limit: limit OS detection to promising targets that have at least one open and one closed TCP port<br />      ◇ --osscan-guess: guess the OS on the host more aggressively<br /><br /><strong>--osscan-guess</strong> → Guess OS detection results. When Nmap is unable to detect a perfect OS match, it sometimes offers up near-matches as possibilities. The match has to be very close for Nmap to do this by default. Either of these (equivalent) options make Nmap guess more aggressively. Nmap will still tell you when an imperfect match is printed and display its confidence level (percentage) for each guess<br /><br /><strong>-Pn</strong> → When we already know that a host is alive(or is possible that a host doesn&#39;t respond to ping probes) we can add this option that <span style="text-decoration:underline;">skip ping scan</span><br />    <a href=""><img src="images/688-1.png" alt="images/688-1.png" /></a><br />    This may happen if a firewall block or rejects some packets altering the fingerprint response<br /><br /><br />Ports usually used by OS:<br />• Linux<br />   ◇ TCP 111 (rpcbind)<br />   ◇ TCP/UDP 2049 (nfs) → typically used to provide access to shared resources, query it with nmap NSE scripts like “nfs-ls,” “nfs-showmount” and “nfs-statfs”<br /></div>
