<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>[general] Server Log Poisoning</h1><br/><br />There are other similar log poisoning techniques that we may utilize on various system logs, depending on which logs we have read access over. <br />The following are some of the service logs we may be able to read:<br /><br />• <strong>/var/log/sshd.log</strong> OR <strong>/var/log/vsftpd.log</strong><br />   1) attempt reading logs through LFI <br />   2) If the service is exposed try to login into them (when we do not know the credentials) and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">set the username</span> to a PHP code (example: execute command)<br />   3) Include the poisoned logs with LFI, the PHP code would execute. <br /><br />• <strong>/var/log/mail</strong><br />   1) attempt reading logs through LFI <br />   2) send an email containing PHP code<br />   3) Include the poisoned logs with LFI, the PHP code would execute.<br /><br /></div>
