One computer hardly creates TCP, UDP, or HTTP requests to overwhelm a web server on its own- garbage requests are readily disregarded, while legitimate requests for web pages are handled normally.<br />Features of LOIC (Low Orbit Ion Cannon)<br /><br />The following are the features of LOIC (Low Orbit Ion Cannon:<br />• LOIC is a free DDoS attack tool that allows us to test our network&#39;s performance.<br />• It enables us to perform stress testing in order to ensure its stability.<br />• With the help of this tool, we can create a DDoS attack online against any website that they control.<br />• We can use this DDoS software to identify DDoS programs that hackers can use to attack a computer network.<br />• LOIC does not hide an IP address even if the proxy server is down.<br /><br /><br />github: <a href="https://github.com/NewEraCracker/LOIC">https://github.com/NewEraCracker/LOIC</a><br /><br />Bibliography:<br /><a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/best-ddos-tools-for-kali-linux">https://www.javatpoint.com/best-ddos-tools-for-kali-linux</a></div>
