<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>source code review</h1><br/><br />The weakest form of validation amongst these is testing the file extension against a blacklist of extension to determine whether the upload request should be blocked. <br /><span style="color:#a52a2a;">example:</span> the following piece of code checks if the uploaded file extension is PHP and drops the request if it is<br />    <div class="codebox"><pre>$fileName = basename($_FILES[&quot;uploadFile&quot;][&quot;name&quot;]);<br />$extension = pathinfo($fileName, PATHINFO_EXTENSION);<br />$blacklist = array(&#39;php&#39;, &#39;php7&#39;, &#39;phps&#39;);<br /><br />if (in_array($extension, $blacklist)) {<br />    echo &quot;File type not allowed&quot;;<br />    die();<br />}</pre></div><br />    The code is taking the file extension ($extension) from the uploaded file name ($fileName) and then comparing it against a list of blacklisted extensions ($blacklist). <br />    <span style="color:#ff0000;">PROBLEM</span> with this example:<br />   ◇ The example above is case-sensitive → is only considering lowercase extensions. <br />       But in <a href="https://stackify.com/iis-web-server/">Windows Servers(IIS)</a>, file names are case insensitive, so we may try uploading a php with a mixed-case (e.g. pHp), which may bypass the blacklist as well, and should still execute as a PHP script.<br /><br /><br /><strong>General </strong><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">PROBLEM</span></strong><strong> of blacklisting</strong><br />It is not comprehensive, as many other extensions are not included in this list, which may still be used to execute PHP code on the back-end server if uploaded</div>
