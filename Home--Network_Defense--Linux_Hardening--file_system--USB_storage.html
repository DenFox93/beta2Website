<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>USB storage</h1><br/><br /><br />USB storage provides a means to transfer and store files insuring persistence and availability of the files independent of network connection status. Its popularity and uility has led to USB-based malware being a simple and common means for network infiltration and a first step to establishing a persistent threat within a networked environment.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Note:</span> An alternative solution to disabling the usb-storage module may be found in USBGuard. Use of USBGuard and construction of USB device policies should be done in alignment with site policy.<br /><br /><strong>Rationale:</strong><br />Restricting USB access on the system will decrease the physical attack surface for a device and diminish the possible vectors to introduce malware.<br /></div>
