<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Windows-specific Attacks</h1><br/><br /><br /><br />On We Server that use Windows (IIS) we can try to:<br />• Use <span style="text-decoration:underline;">reserved characters for special uses</span>, such as (|, &lt;, &gt;, *, or ?) <br />	If the web application does not properly sanitize these names or wrap them within quotes, they may refer to another file (which may not exist) and cause an error that discloses the upload directory. <br />• Use <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Windows reserved names</span> for the uploaded file name, like (CON, COM1, LPT1, or NUL)<br />	Can cause an error as the web application will not be allowed to write a file with this name.<br />• Use the Windows<span style="color:#a4b1cd;"> </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8.3_filename">8.3 Filename Convention</a><span style="color:#a4b1cd;"> </span><br />   ◇ access existing files<br />      ▪ private sensitive file<br />   ◇ to overwrite existing files<br />      ▪ useful to overwite sensitive system files<br />   ◇ refer to files that do not exist. <br />      ▪ information disclosure through error<br />	Older versions of Windows were limited to a short length for file names, so they used a Tilde character (~) to complete the file name, which we can use to our advantage.<br />	<span style="color:#865e3c;">example</span>: to refer to a file called (hackthebox.txt) we can use (HAC~1.TXT) or (HAC~2.TXT), where the digit represents the order of the matching files that start with (HAC). As Windows still supports this convention, we can write a file called (e.g. WEB~.CONF) to overwrite the web.conf file.<br />	<br /></div>
