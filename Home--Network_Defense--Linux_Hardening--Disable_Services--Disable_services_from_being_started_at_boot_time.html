<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Disable services from being started at boot time</h1><br/><br />In the AT&amp;T System V (SysV) scheme each service come with a script that can be used to start/stop the service. <br />While usually each script is supposed to control a single service, some OSs like Solaris could place multiple services in a single script. The important thing anyway is that the they get started in the correct dependency order.<br /><br /><br />Scripts that start/stop various services are placed usually in <strong>/etc/init.d</strong>, but this directory could change a little bit from a UNIX OS to another.<br /><br /></div>
