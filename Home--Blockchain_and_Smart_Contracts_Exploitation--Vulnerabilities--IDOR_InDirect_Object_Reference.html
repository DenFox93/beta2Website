<div class='page'><h1 class='title'> IDOR: InDirect Object Reference</h1><br/><br />In this chapter we will understand and attack Authentication &amp; Authorization On The Ethereum Blockchain using <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Indirect Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerabilities</span> that can allow to bypass UI unprotected functionality <br /><br /><br /><strong><h3>Smart Contract Authorization and Visibility</h3></strong><br />Smart contracts role is the same as an API that use a frontend as interface to its functionality. <br />You can code DApps for various platforms and access needed functionality within smart contracts for value transfers with functional logic. <br /><br /><strong>Visibility of a function</strong><br />A <span style="color:#ff0000;text-decoration:underline;">common issue</span><span style="text-decoration:underline;"> in the older versions of solidity(before </span><a href="https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/050-breaking-changes.html">v0.5.0</a><span style="text-decoration:underline;">) was that smart contract functions had public visibility by default</span>, meaning that they were accessible by anyone knew how to interact with them. If you didn’t explicitly define the access level of the function it would automatically default to public, allowing anyone to call the function and perform actions using the contracts ABI. From 0.5.0 Explicit function visibility is mandatory<br />In newer versions of solidity, the compiler will complain and refuse to compile if you do not <span style="text-decoration:underline;">explicitly define the visibility of a function</span>(after <a href="https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/050-breaking-changes.html">v0.5.0</a>) as one of the following:<br />   ◇ External →  Is accessible to other contracts but cannot be accessed internally to the contract<br />   ◇ Public →  Is accessible to other contracts and can be accessed internally<br />   ◇ Internal →  Can only be accessed within the current contract or contracts deriving from it<br />   ◇ Private →  These are only visible by the contract that defined them.<br /><br /><span style="color:#a5452a;">example: Private vs Public functions</span><br /><div class="codebox"><pre>pragma solidity ^0.6.6;<br /><br />contract visibility {<br />    <span style="color:#0088ff;font-weight:400">//a private function cannot be called directly from an external call/interface</span><br />    function add(uint _a, uint _b) private pure returns (uint){<br />        <span style="color:#ff9d00;font-weight:700">return</span> _a + _b; <br />    }<br />    <br />    function get_add_result(uint a, uint b) public pure returns (uint){<br />        <span style="color:#0088ff;font-weight:400">//but is possible to call private functions within the contract</span><br />        <span style="color:#ff9d00;font-weight:700">return</span> add(a, b);<br />    }<br />}</pre></div><br />     In the deployed contract, we can see that we have only a button to call the public function get_add_result and not the private add function.<br />    <a href=""><img src="images/1417-1.png" alt="images/1417-1.png" /></a><br />    <br />    <br />    <br />*In a smart contract we need a way to actually tell who has access to a public function in order to setup authorized transactions</div>
