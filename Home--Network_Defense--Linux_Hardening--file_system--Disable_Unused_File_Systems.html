<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Disable Unused File Systems</h1><br/> Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the system. Many filesystems are created for niche use cases and are not maintained and supported as the operating systems are updated and patched.<br /><br />To disable these filesystems you need to edit the file /etc/modprobe.conf<br /><br />• <strong>cramfs</strong><br />    compressed read-only Linux filesystem. It is mainly used in embedded and small-footprint systems. Unlike a compressed image of a conventional file system, a cramfs image can be used as it is, i.e. without first decompressing it.<br />   In 2013, Linux maintainers indicated that cramfs was made obsolete by squashfs, but the file system got rehabilitated in 2017 for use in low-memory devices where using squashfs may not be viable.<br /><br />• <strong>freevxfs</strong><br />    FreeVxFS is a freely available implementationof the VxFS filesystem format for Linux, implemented only by looking at the very rarelyavailable public documentation and reverse engineering the SCO UnixWare version of thecommercially available VXFS driver<br />   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veritas_File_System">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veritas_File_System</a><br /><br />• <strong>jffs2</strong><br />    JFFS2 is a filesystem that was designed to be used on solid-state memory devices (such as NAND or NOR). It performs automatic wear-leveling to increase the life of the chip, and is aware of bad-blocks on NAND flash<br /><br />•<strong> hfs </strong><br />    Hierarchical File System (HFS) is a proprietary file system developed by Apple Inc. for use in computer systems running Mac OS. Originally designed for use on floppy and hard disks, it can also be found on read-only media such as CD-ROMs. <br />    With the introduction of Mac OS X 10.6 (2011), Apple dropped support for formatting or writing HFS disks and images, which remain supported as read-only volumes. Starting with macOS 10.15, HFS disks can no longer be read.<br /><br />• <strong>hfsplus</strong><br />    HFS+ continued as the primary Mac OS X file system until it was itself replaced with the Apple File System (APFS), released with macOS High Sierra in 2017. HFS+ is also one of the formats used by the iPod digital music player.<br />    Compared to its predecessor HFS, also called Mac OS Standard or HFS Standard, HFS Plus supports much larger files (block addresses are 32-bit length instead of 16-bit) and using Unicode (instead of Mac OS Roman or any of several other character sets) for naming items. <br /><br />• <strong>squashfs</strong><br />    Squashfs is a compressed read-only file system for Linux. Squashfs compresses files, inodes and directories, and supports block sizes from 4 KiB up to 1 MiB for greater compression. Several compression algorithms are supported. Squashfs is also the name of free software, licensed under the GPL, for accessing Squashfs filesystems.<br />    Squashfs is used by the Live CD versions of Arch Linux, Debian, Fedora, Gentoo Linux, HoleOS, Linux Mint, Salix, Ubuntu, Clonezilla and on embedded distributions such as the OpenWrt and DD-WRT router firmware. It is also used in Chromecast and for the system partitions of some Android releases (Android Nougat).<br /><br />• <strong>udf</strong><br />    <h3> </h3>It has been most widely used for DVDs and newer optical disc formats. Due to its design, it is very well suited to incremental updates on both recordable and (re)writable optical media</div>
