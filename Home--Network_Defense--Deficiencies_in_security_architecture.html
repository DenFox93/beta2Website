<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Deficiencies in security architecture</h1><br/><br /><br /><strong><h3>Traditional deficiencies in security architecture include:</h3></strong><br />• <strong>Emphasis on perimeter</strong><br />    Emphasis on the security of the perimeter of the Network and assume that the Internal Network(or WAN) is secure.<br />    Only separating systems on VLANs(<a href="https://kb.netgear.com/21574/What-is-a-virtual-LAN-VLAN-and-how-does-it-work-with-my-managed-switch">what are?</a>)  does not address the issue. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">There must also be ACLs</span> (Access Control Lists) firewall rules, etc.<br />    Many organizations ignore basic layer 2 hardening best practices on the flawed assumption that the black hat requires local access to launch them. <br />    If an attacker compromises a local system via a phishing campaign, he could launch layer 2 attacks, including ARP cache poisoning, MAC address spoofing, DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) attacks,...<br />• <strong>Lack of true perimeter (de-perimeterization via cloud/mobile/IoT)</strong><br />    While Classic firewall/perimeter design is often described using a castle analogy: the walls are the firewall, protecting devices on the inside.<br />    Cloud, mobile devices and the Internet of Things (IoT) makes this model (and analogy) far less effective since firewall cannot protect them.<br />• <strong>Prevention Control emphasized</strong><br />    Firewalls, antivirus, patching, host and network-based IPSes (HIPS and NIPS) are primarily preventive controls<br />    Detection controls (IDS) are also important!<br />• <strong>The Internet of Things (IoT)</strong><br />    Usually they lack of patches and Software updates <br />• <strong>Predominantly </strong><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">network-centric</span></strong><br />    While security on the Network Architecture is important, most recent attacks has moved to the host itseft, precisely on the Application layer. <br />    An Application layer(7) attack could include a phishing email containing a &#39;poison PDF&#39;. <br />• <strong>Compliance-driven security</strong><br />    While being PCI compliant is undoubtedly a good thing, it&#39;s not enough. Organizations must go beyond complying with the letter of the compliance standard.<br />• <strong>We Always Did It This Way</strong><br />   Delay or reject necessary change are not a good thing<br />• <strong>Introducing Technology without Analysis</strong><br />    Introduce tools without careful planning and consideration they could give a false sense of security<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/network/windows-network-architecture-and-the-osi-model">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/network/windows-network-architecture-and-the-osi-model</a></div>
