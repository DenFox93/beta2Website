<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Second-Order Attacks</h1><br/><br />Second Order Attack occurs because many web application functionalities may be insecurely pulling files from the back-end server based on user-controlled parameters.<br /><span style="color:#a52a2a;">example:</span> a web application may allow us to download our avatar through a URL like (<code>/profile/$username/avatar.png</code>).<br />   1) If we craft a malicious LFI username (e.g. <code>../../../etc/passwd</code>), then it may be possible to change the file being pulled to another local file on the server and grab it instead of our avatar.<br />   2) In this case, we could poisoning a database entry with a malicious LFI payload in our username. <br />      It is possible that another web application functionality utilize this poisoned entry to perform our attack <br />   This attack is composed of two parts is why this attack is called a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Second-Order attack</span>.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Note:</span> Developers may protect against direct user input (e.g. from a GET <code>?page</code> parameter), but they may trust values pulled from their database. If we are been able to insert data inside a the database(es: username registration), then the attack would be possible.<br /><br /><br /></div>
