<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>14. Passive Traffic Capture</h1><br/><br />If tcpdump is installed, unprivileged users may be able to capture network traffic, including, in some cases, credentials passed in cleartext. <br />Several tools exist, such as <a href="https://github.com/DanMcInerney/net-creds">net-creds</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lgandx/PCredz">PCredz</a> that can be used to examine data being passed on the wire. <br />This may result in capture :<br />• sensitive information such as credit card numbers and SNMP community strings. <br />• Net-NTLMv2, SMBv2, or Kerberos hashes, which could be subjected to an offline brute force attack to reveal the plaintext password<br />• credentials that could be reused to escalate privileges on the host from cleartext protocols such as HTTP, FTP, POP, IMAP, telnet, or SMTP </div>
