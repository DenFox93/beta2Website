<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>HTTP Headers</h1><br/><br />Some headers are only used with either requests or responses, while some other general headers are common to both<br /><br /><br /><strong><h3>General Headers</h3></strong><br /><a href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec4.html">General headers</a> are used in both HTTP requests and responses. <br />• They are used to describe the message rather than its contents.<br /><table class="table"><tr><th>Header</th><th>Example</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>Date</td><td>Date: Wed, 16 Feb 2022 10:38:44 GMT</td><td>Holds the date and time at which the message originated. It&#39;s preferred to convert the time to the standard UTC time zone.</td></tr><tr><td>Connection</td><td>Connection: close</td><td>Dictates if the current network connection should stay alive after the request finishes. Two commonly used values for this header are close and keep-alive. The close value from either the client or server means that they would like to terminate the connection, while the keep-alive header indicates that the connection should remain open to receive more data and input.</td></tr></table><br /><br /><br /><strong><h3>Entity Headers</h3></strong><br />Similar to general headers, <a href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec7.html">Entity Headers</a> can be common to both the request and response. <br />• Used to describe the content (entity) transferred by a message. <br />• They are usually found in responses and POST or PUT requests.<br /><table class="table"><tr><th>Header</th><th>Example</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>Content-Type</td><td>Content-Type: text/html</td><td>Used to describe the type of resource being transferred. The value is automatically added by the browsers on the client-side and returned in the server response. The charset field denotes the encoding standard, such as UTF-8.</td></tr><tr><td>Media-Type</td><td>Media-Type: application/pdf</td><td>The media-type is similar to Content-Type, and describes the data being transferred. This header can play a crucial role in making the server interpret our input. The charset field may also be used with this header.</td></tr><tr><td>Boundary</td><td>boundary=&quot;b4e4fbd93540&quot;</td><td>Acts as a maker to separate content when there is more than one in the same message. For example, within a form data, this boundary gets used as --b4e4fbd93540 to separate different parts of the form.</td></tr><tr><td>Content-Length</td><td>Content-Length: 385</td><td>Holds the size of the entity being passed. This header is necessary as the server uses it to read data from the message body, and is automatically generated by the browser and tools like cURL.</td></tr><tr><td>Content-Encoding</td><td>Content-Encoding: gzip</td><td>Data can undergo multiple transformations before being passed. For example, large amounts of data can be compressed to reduce the message size. The type of encoding being used should be specified using the Content-Encoding header.</td></tr></table><br /><br /><br /><strong><h3>Request Headers</h3></strong><br />The client sends <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616">Request Headers</a> in an HTTP transaction.<br />• These headers are used in an HTTP request and do not relate to the content of the message. <br />• A complete list of request headers and their usage can be found here: <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-5">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-5</a><br /><table class="table"><tr><th>Header</th><th>Example</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>Host</td><td>Host: www.inlanefreight.com</td><td>Used to specify the host being queried for the resource. This can be a domain name or an IP address. HTTP servers can be configured to host different websites, which are revealed based on the hostname. This makes the host header an important enumeration target, as it can indicate the existence of other hosts on the target server.</td></tr><tr><td>User-Agent</td><td>User-Agent: curl/7.77.0</td><td>The User-Agent header is used to describe the client requesting resources. This header can reveal a lot about the client, such as the browser, its version, and the operating system.</td></tr><tr><td>Referer</td><td>Referer: http://www.inlanefreight.com/</td><td>Denotes where the current request is coming from. For example, clicking a link from Google search results would make https://google.com the referer. Trusting this header can be dangerous as it can be easily manipulated, leading to unintended consequences.</td></tr><tr><td>Accept</td><td>Accept: */*</td><td>The Accept header describes which media types the client can understand. It can contains multiple media types separated by commas. The */* value signifies that all media types are accepted.</td></tr><tr><td>Cookie</td><td>Cookie: PHPSESSID=b4e4fbd93540</td><td>Contains cookie-value pairs in the format name=value. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the client-side and on the server, which acts as an identifier. These are passed to the server per request, thus maintaining the client&#39;s access. Cookies can also serve other purposes, such as saving user preferences or session tracking. There can be multiple cookies in a single header separated by a semi-colon.</td></tr><tr><td>Authorization</td><td>Authorization: BASIC cGFzc3dvcmQK</td><td>Another method for the server to identify clients. After successful authentication, the server returns a token unique to the client. Unlike cookies, tokens are stored only on the client-side and retrieved by the server per request. There are multiple types of authentication types based on the webserver and application type used.</td></tr></table><br /><br /><br /><br /><strong><h3>Response Headers</h3></strong><br /><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6">Response Headers</a><span style="color:#a4b1cd;"> </span>can be used in an HTTP response and do not relate to the content. <br /><table class="table"><tr><th>Header</th><th>Example</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>Server</td><td>Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Win32)</td><td>Contains information about the HTTP server, which processed the request. It can be used to gain information about the server, such as its version, and enumerate it further.</td></tr><tr><td>Set-Cookie</td><td>Set-Cookie: PHPSESSID=b4e4fbd93540</td><td>Contains the cookies needed for client identification. Browsers parse the cookies and store them for future requests. This header follows the same format as the Cookie request header.</td></tr><tr><td>WWW-Authenticate</td><td>WWW-Authenticate: BASIC realm=&quot;localhost&quot;</td><td>Notifies the client about the type of authentication required to access the requested resource.</td></tr></table><br /><br /><br /><strong><h3>Security Headers</h3></strong><br />Finally, we have <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-headers/">Security Headers</a>. With the increase in the variety of browsers and web-based attacks, defining certain headers that enhanced security was necessary.<br />HTTP Security headers are a class of response headers used to specify certain rules and policies to be followed by the browser while accessing the website.<br /><table class="table"><tr><th>Header</th><th>Example</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>Content-Security-Policy</td><td>Content-Security-Policy: script-src &#39;self&#39;</td><td>Dictates the website&#39;s policy towards externally injected resources. This could be JavaScript code as well as script resources. This header instructs the browser to accept resources only from certain trusted domains, hence preventing attacks such as Cross-site scripting (XSS).</td></tr><tr><td>Strict-Transport-Security</td><td>Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000</td><td>Prevents the browser from accessing the website over the plaintext HTTP protocol, and forces all communication to be carried over the secure HTTPS protocol. This prevents attackers from sniffing web traffic and accessing protected information such as passwords or other sensitive data.</td></tr><tr><td>Referrer-Policy</td><td>Referrer-Policy: origin</td><td>Dictates whether the browser should include the value specified via the Referer header or not. It can help in avoiding disclosing sensitive URLs and information while browsing the website.</td></tr></table><br /><br /><br />Bibliography:<br /><a href="https://academy.hackthebox.com/">https://academy.hackthebox.com/</a><br /><br /></div>
